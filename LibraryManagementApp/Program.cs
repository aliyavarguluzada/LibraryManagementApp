 Application Idea: Library Management System

Description:
Create a console-based library management system where users can manage books, library members, and borrowing records.

Features:

Book Management:

Add a new book to the library.
Update book information (e.g., title, author, genre).
Remove a book from the library.
Display a list of all available books.
Member Management:

Add a new member to the library.
Update member information (e.g., name, contact details).
Remove a member from the library.
Display a list of all library members.
Borrowing Management:

Allow a member to borrow a book.
Check if a book is available for borrowing.
Display a list of all borrowed books and their respective borrowers.
Allow a member to return a borrowed book.
Implementation:
To implement this application, you can create the following classes:

Book:

Properties: book ID, title, author, genre, availability status, etc.
Methods: GetBookInfo(), UpdateAvailability(), etc.
Member:

Properties: member ID, name, contact details, etc.
Methods: GetMemberInfo(), UpdateContactDetails(), etc.
Library:

Properties: list of books, list of members, etc.
Methods: AddBook(), RemoveBook(), AddMember(), RemoveMember(), etc.
BorrowingRecord:

Properties: book, member, issue date, due date, return date, etc.
Methods: GetRecordInfo(), UpdateReturnDate(), etc.
The main program can provide a menu-based interface 
where users can select different options to perform various operations on books, members, and borrowing records. 
Additionally, you can store the data in memory using appropriate data structures (e.g., lists) 
or utilize a simple file system for data persistence.
